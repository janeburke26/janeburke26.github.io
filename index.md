# About Me 
My name is Jane Burke and I am an incoming sophmore at Lehigh University from Boston Massachussetts. I am currenlty undecided in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh with hopes or pursuing a minor in Mass Communication. I have two younger sisters, a yellow labrador named Poppy and in my free time I enjoy listening to music, running, and singing.

# Personal Experience With Github 
Prior to this summer, I have had no experience with Github, no experince with programming and very little coding experience. I look forward to becoming more familiar with Github as it is a very powerful tool when it comes to editing, publicating and educating others on the power of data visualization.
